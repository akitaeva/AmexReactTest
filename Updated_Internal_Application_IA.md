# Internal Application Information Architecture

For an enterprise internal application serving as a catalog and central hub for maintainers of Java, JS, and Rust functions within a micro front-end infrastructure, the information architecture (IA) should balance discoverability, usability, and maintainability. Based on your Explorer UI/UX Overhaul document, hereâ€™s a well-structured IA:

## 1. Core Navigation (Global IA)

The top-level IA should be structured to align with user needs and function management workflows:

### **Dashboard**

- Personalized view (session history, active functions, alerts)
- Quick access to recent changes & impacted dependencies
- High-level system status (e.g., version drift, vulnerabilities)

### **Function Catalog**

#### **Browse by Technology**

- Java Functions
- JavaScript/Node.js Functions
- Rust Functions

#### **Browse by Micro Front End**

- MFEs grouped by business unit/team
- Shared modules (e.g., state management, auth, logging)

#### **Browse by Lifecycle Stage**

- In Development
- Active in Production
- Deprecated

### **Dependency Management**

- **Version Tracking**: Mismatches & recommendations
- **Shared Libraries**: Optimized for reuse
- **Vulnerability Insights**: Security alerts and patches

### **System Architecture**

- Holistic visualization of interconnected MFEs
- Best practices, governance policies
- Living documentation for maintainers

### **Performance & Optimization**

- **Function usage analytics**
- **Redundant/unused functions**
- **Recommendations for consolidation**

### **Onboarding & Guides**

- Getting started for new engineers
- Best practices for adding functions
- Enterprise design system integration

### **Tools/**

- **Dependency Analyzer**: Track dependency versions, usage, and impact
- **Deployment Analytics**: Monitor deployment status & performance trends
- **Health Monitor**: Real-time monitoring of function performance and alerting for failures

---

## 2. Detailed Hierarchy (Sub-Navigation & Feature Interconnectivity)

Each function within the Function Catalog should have **detailed metadata**:

### **Overview**

- Function description, author, and version
- Micro front end/module associations
- API contracts and schema

### **Code & Dependencies**

- Direct and transitive dependencies
- Externalized vs. bundled libraries
- Security analysis

### **Usage & Performance**

- Call frequency, execution time
- Error logs & alerts
- Impact analysis (what breaks if this function is removed?)

### **Governance & History**

- Lifecycle status (Active, Deprecated, etc.)
- Changelog/versioning
- Ownership & approval workflows

---

## 3. Interaction Model

### **Module Federation for Scalability**

- Dynamic loading of MFEs using Holocron (or One-App)
- Ensuring each MFE is self-contained yet interconnected

### **Smart Search & Filtering**

- Typeahead search with categorization (functions, dependencies, errors)
- Advanced filters (e.g., function type, MFE, last updated)

### **Visualization & Impact Analysis**

- Graph-based dependency trees
- Heatmaps for function usage

### **Customization for Power Users**

- User-configurable dashboards
- Saved searches and notification settings

---

## 4. User-Centered Design (Tailored for Personas)

### **For New Engineers**

- Guided onboarding flows
- Beginner-friendly documentation
- Visual walkthroughs of the MFE ecosystem

### **For Function Maintainers & Architects**

- Deep-dive analytics (performance, security)
- Version control with dependency drift tracking
- Ability to suggest optimizations
